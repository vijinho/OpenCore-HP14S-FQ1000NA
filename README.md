# # HP 14S-FQ1000NA Opencore Ryzen 5500U Laptop

Unfortunately this laptop had some hardware issues so I no longer own it, but I hope that will help someone else. If you do find a wireless card that works though, let me know.



An SMBIOS is required for *MacbookPro 16,3*

## Working:

- Vega Graphics Acceleration

- Brightness buttons

- Touchpad with multi-touch

- SD-Card Reader 

- In-built Speaker

- USB ports 

## Not-working:

- Wireless - I tried to replace the built-in WiFi/Bluetooth card with an Intel 9265NGW and Intel AX210 but neither worked, only the Bluetooth, and the wireless didn't show-up as a device at all, so there may be some kind of HP whitelist in operation. 

- In-built Microphone
